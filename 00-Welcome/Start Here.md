# Ken's Vault

Welcome to `Ken's Vault`. This page will be intended for creating my [[Personal Knowledge Management System]] as well as to use this as a tool for archiving my thoughts and goals and stuff.

### Why note taking matters
Note taking has been a part of my career's initiative as a __*Network Engineer*__, since we are being paid for what we know. This will also be an avenue for me to `dump all my knowledge in a structured form` and access it on-the-go. This will also be my go to when i have time to chill and just take notes from the web and find inspirations as well.

### Motivation

My greatest motivation in pushing this project into frutuition is through the support of my ever dearest loving girlfriend, who at this time, is also studying for her exams. She gave the advice to proceed with this project and hopefully to publish this to Github.

To quote:
>Success is not about perfection.
  It's about __*progress*__.
